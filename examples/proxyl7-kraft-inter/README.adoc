= KRaft Kafka 2.8 Cluster with Intern L7 Proxy Communication

Example with a L7 Kafka Proxy and a Kafka 2.8 Cluster with KRaft using plaintext.
The Kafka image with KRaft support is developed at: https://github.com/ueisele/kafka-images

NOTE: Using Docker image _ueisele/ueisele-kafka-server:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20210703T1922UTC_ from Git repository https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/tree/fix/kraft-advertisedlisteners-trunk. It contains a fix which advertises the actual advertised port and not the socket server port (see https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/blob/d491d5be92ee4a579b51895ae0cb7d55e865fa03/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L278). or this fix also a pull request has been created (see https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10935). Kafka 2.8.0 returns the socket server port instead of the advertised port and therefore this example does not work with this version.
