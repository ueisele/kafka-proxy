= KRaft Kafka 2.8 Cluster with Intern L7 Proxy Communication

Example with a L7 Kafka Proxy and a Kafka 2.8 Cluster with KRaft using plaintext.
The Kafka image with KRaft support is developed at: https://github.com/ueisele/kafka-images

NOTE: Using Docker image _ueisele/apache-kafka-server:0.8.0-beta1-8700-g73a54c5_ (3.0.0-SNAPSHOT). It contains a fix which advertises the actual advertised port and not the socket server port (see commit https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/73a54c5265231b3d764391b70572626a876f1e27 and pull-request https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10935). Kafka 2.8.0 returns the socket server port instead of the advertised port and therefore this example does not work with this version.
