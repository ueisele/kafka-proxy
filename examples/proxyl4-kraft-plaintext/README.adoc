= KRaft Kafka Cluster and Envoy Proxy

The envoy proxy listens on ports 909[1-3] and forwards to the corresponding Kafka Broker [1-3] to port 19092. The Kafka Brokers are listening on port 19092 and advertises the envoy proxy hostname and their corresponding port (909[1-3]).

NOTE: Using Docker image _ueisele/ueisele-kafka-server:2.8.0-24-g384d5cc_ from Git repository https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/tree/fix/kraft-advertisedlisteners. It contains a fix which advertises the actual advertised port and not the socket server port (see https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/commit/384d5cc983d77139f06d5cbce296c64e4ff8faa2). Kafka 2.8.0 returns the socket server port instead of the advertised port and therefor this example does not work with this version.
